# Packages Used Today

This workshop focuses on using packages from the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

--

The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages which share a design philosophy, syntax, and data structures.

--

The `tidyverse` includes the most used packages in the R world: [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

--

You can install the *entire* `tidyverse` with the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

--

We will also use the `gapminder` and `nycflights13` datasets:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("gapminder")
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

# Subsetting Data with `dplyr`


---
# But First, Pipes: `%>%`

`dplyr` uses the [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) forward pipe operator, usually called simply a **pipe**. We write pipes like **`%>%`** (`Ctrl+Shift+M` or `⌘ +Shift+M`).

--

Pipes take the object on the *left* and apply the function on the *right*: `x %>% f(y) = f(x, y)`. Read out loud: "and then..."

--

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Canada") %>% head(2)
```

--

Pipes save us typing, make code readable, and allow chaining like above, so we use them *all the time* when manipulating data frames.

---

# Using Pipes


Pipes are clearest to read when you have each function on a separate line.

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
take_this_data %>%
    do_first_thing(with = this_value) %>%
    do_next_thing(using = that_value) %>% ...
```

--

Stuff to the left of the pipe is passed to the *first argument* of the function on the right. Other arguments go on the right in the function. 

--

If you ever find yourself piping a function where data are not the first argument, use `.` in the data argument instead.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% lm(pop ~ year, data = .)
```

---

# Pipe Assignment

When creating a new object from the output of piped functions, you place the assignment operator *at the beginning*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lm_pop_year <- gapminder %>% 
  lm(pop ~ year, data = .)
```

No matter how long the chain of functions is, assignment is always done *at the top*.

---

# `filter` Data Frames

I used **`filter()`** earlier. We subset *rows* of data using logical conditions with `filter()`!

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Oman") %>% head(8)
```

What is this doing?

---

# Logical Operators

Logical operators test boolean conditions and return `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NA`.

--

`filter()` returns rows when the condition is `TRUE`.

We used `==` for testing "equals": `country == "Oman"`.

--

There are many other [logical operators](http://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html):

--

* `!=`: not equal to
--

* `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`: less than, less than or equal to, etc.
--

* `%in%`: used with checking equal to one of several values

--

Or we can combine multiple logical conditions:

* `&`: both conditions need to hold (AND)
--

* `|`: at least one condition needs to hold (OR)
--

* `!`: inverts a logical condition (`TRUE` becomes `FALSE`, `FALSE` becomes `TRUE`)

---

# Multiple Conditions Example

Let's say we want observations from Oman after 1980 and through 2000.

--

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(country == "Oman" &
           year > 1980 &
           year <= 2000 )
```

---
# `%in%` Operator

Common use case: Filter rows to things in some *set*.

We can use `%in%` like `==` but for matching *any element* in the vector on its right<sup>1</sup>. 

```{r}
former_yugoslavia <- c("Bosnia and Herzegovina", "Croatia", #<<
              "Macedonia", "Montenegro", "Serbia", "Slovenia") #<<
yugoslavia <- gapminder %>% filter(country %in% former_yugoslavia)
tail(yugoslavia, 2)
```

.footnote[[1] The `c()` function is how we make **vectors** in R, which are an important data type.]

---
## Sorting: `arrange()`

Along with filtering the data to see certain rows, we might want to sort it:

```{r}
yugoslavia %>% arrange(year, desc(pop))
```

The data are sorted by ascending `year` and descending `pop`.

---
## Keeping Columns: `select()`

Not only can we subset rows, but we can include specific columns (and put them in the order listed) using **`select()`**. 

```{r}
yugoslavia %>% select(country, year, pop) %>% head(4)
```

---
## Dropping Columns: `select()`


We can instead drop only specific columns with `select()` using `-` signs:

```{r}
yugoslavia %>% select(-continent, -pop, -lifeExp) %>% head(4)
```

---
## Helper Functions for `select()`


`select()` has a variety of helper functions like `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, and `contains()`, or can be given a range of continguous columns `startvar:endvar`. See `?select` for details.

These are very useful if you have a "wide" data frame with column names following a pattern or ordering. 

![DYS Data Example](http://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/Lectures/Week3/img/dys_vars.PNG)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
DYS %>% select(starts_with("married"))
DYS %>% select(ends_with("18"))
```

---
## Renaming Columns with `select()`


We can rename columns using `select()`, but that drops everything that isn't mentioned:

```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
    select(Life_Expectancy = lifeExp) %>%
    head(4)
```

---
### Safer: Rename Columns with `rename()`


**`rename()`** renames variables using the same syntax as `select()` without dropping unmentioned variables.

```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
    select(country, year, lifeExp) %>%
    rename(Life_Expectancy = lifeExp) %>%
    head(4)
```

---
class: inverse
# Creating Variables

---
## `mutate()`

In `dplyr`, you can add new columns to a data frame using **`mutate()`**.


```{r}
yugoslavia %>% filter(country == "Serbia") %>%
    select(year, pop, lifeExp) %>%
    mutate(pop_million = pop / 1000000, #<<
           life_exp_past_40 = lifeExp - 40) %>% #<<
    head(5)
```

.footnote[Note you can create multiple variables in a single `mutate()` call by separating the expressions with commas.]

---
# `ifelse()`


A common function used in `mutate()` (and in general in R programming) is **`ifelse()`**. It returns a vector of values depending on a logical test.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ifelse(test = x==y, yes = first_value , no = second_value)
```

Output from `ifelse()` if `x==y` is...
* `TRUE`: `first_value` - the value for `yes =`

* `FALSE`: `second_value` - the value for `no = `

* `NA`: `NA` - because you can't test for NA with an equality!

--

For example:

```{r}
example <- c(1, 0, NA, -2)
ifelse(example > 0, "Positive", "Not Positive")
```

---
# `ifelse()` Example


```{r}
yugoslavia %>% mutate(short_country = 
                 ifelse(country == "Bosnia and Herzegovina", 
                        "B and H", as.character(country))) %>%
    select(short_country, year, pop) %>%
    arrange(year, short_country) %>%
    head(3)
```

Read this as "For each row, if country equals 'Bosnia and Herzegovina', make `short_country` equal to 'B and H', otherwise make it equal to that row's value of `country`."

This is a simple way to change some values but not others!

---
# `case_when()`

**`case_when()`** performs multiple `ifelse()` operations at the same time. `case_when()` allows you to create a new variable with values based on multiple logical statements. This is useful for making categorical variables or variables from combinations of other variables.
.smallish[
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdpPercap_ordinal = 
    case_when(
      gdpPercap <  700 ~ "low",
      gdpPercap >= 700 & gdpPercap < 800 ~ "moderate",
      TRUE ~ "high" )) %>% # Value when all other statements are FALSE
  slice(6:9) # get rows 6 through 9
```
]

---
class: inverse

# Summarizing Data

---
## General Aggregation: `summarize()`

**`summarize()`** takes your column(s) of data and computes something using every row: 

* Count how many rows there are
* Calculate the mean
* Compute the sum
* Obtain a minimum or maximum value

You can use any function in `summarize()` that aggregates *multiple values* into a *single value* (like `sd()`, `mean()`, or `max()`).


---
# `summarize()` Example

For the year 1982, let's get the *number of observations*, *total population*, *mean life expectancy*, and *range of life expectancy* for former Yugoslavian countries.

```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
    filter(year == 1982) %>%
    summarize(n_obs = n(),
              total_pop = sum(pop),
              mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp),
              range_life_exp = max(lifeExp) - min(lifeExp))
```

These new variables are calculated using *all of the rows* in `yugoslavia`

---
# Avoiding Repetition: 

### `summarize_at()`


Maybe you need to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a bunch of columns. With **`summarize_at()`**, put the variables to compute over first `vars()` (using `select()` syntax) and put the functions to use in `funs()` after.

```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
    filter(year == 1982) %>%
    summarize_at(vars(lifeExp, pop), funs(mean, sd))
```

Note it automatically names the summarized variables based on the functions used to summarize.

---
# Avoiding Repetition

### Other functions:


There are additional `dplyr` functions similar to `summarize_at()`:

* `summarize_all()` and `mutate_all()` summarize / mutate *all* variables sent to them in the same way. For instance, getting the mean and standard deviation of an entire dataframe:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataframe %>% summarize_all(funs(mean, sd))
```

* `summarize_if()` and `mutate_if()` summarize / mutate all variables that satisfy some logical condition. For instance, summarizing every numeric column in a dataframe at once:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataframe %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, funs(mean, sd))
```

You can use all of these to avoid typing out the same code repeatedly!

---
# `group_by()`


The special function **`group_by()`** changes how subsequent functions operate on the data, most importantly `summarize()`.

Functions after `group_by()` are computed *within each group* as defined by unique valus of the variables given, rather than over all rows at once.

Typically the variables you group by will be integers, factors, or characters, and *not continuous real values*.

---
`group_by()` example


```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
  group_by(year) %>% #<<
    summarize(num_countries = n_distinct(country),
              total_pop = sum(pop),
              total_gdp_per_cap = sum(pop*gdpPercap)/total_pop) %>%
    head(5)
```

Because we did `group_by()` with `year` then used `summarize()`, we get *one row per value of `year`*!

Each value of year is its own **group**!

---
## Window Functions

Grouping can also be used with `mutate()` or `filter()` to give rank orders within a group, lagged values, and cumulative sums. You can read more about window functions in this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html).

```{r}
yugoslavia %>% 
  select(country, year, pop) %>%
  filter(year >= 2002) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(lag_pop = lag(pop, order_by = year),
         pop_chg = pop - lag_pop) %>%
  head(4)
```

# Initial Spot Checks

.smallish[
First things to check after loading new data:
]
--

.smallish[
* Did the last rows/columns from the original file make it in?

    + May need to use different package or manually specify range
]
--

.smallish[
* Are the column names in good shape?

    + Modify a `col_names=` argument or fix with `rename()`
]
--
.smallish[

* Are there "decorative" blank rows or columns to remove?

    + `filter()` or `select()` out those rows/columns
]
--
.smallish[

* How are missing values represented: `NA`, `" "` (blank), `.` (period), `999`?

    + Use `mutate()` with `ifelse()` to fix these (perhaps *en masse* with looping)
]
--
.smallish[

* Are there character data (e.g. ZIP codes with leading zeroes) being incorrectly represented as numeric or vice versa?

    + Modify `col_types=` argument, or use `mutate()` and `as.numeric()`
]

--

* What is an observation?
    + A group of students from a program of a given gender
* What are the variables?
    + Program, Gender, Count
* What are the values?
    + Program: Evans School, Arts & Sciences, Public Health, Other
    + Gender: Female, Male -- **in the column headings, not its own column!**
    + Count: **spread over two columns!**

Each variable is a column.

Each observation is a row.

# Billboard Data

We're going to work with some *ugly* data: *The Billboard Hot 100 for the year 2000*.

We can load it like so:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr) # Contains read_csv()
billboard_2000_raw <- 
  read_csv(file = "data/billboard.csv",
           col_types = paste(c("icccD", rep("i", 76)), collapse="")) #<<
```

.footnote[`col_types=` is used to specify column types. [See here for details.](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/Lectures/Week5/CSSS508_week5_data_import_export_cleaning.html#29)]

---
# Billboard is Just Ugly-Messy

.small[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(pander)
pander(head(billboard_2000_raw[,1:10], 12), split.tables=120, style="rmarkdown")
```
]

Week columns continue up to `wk76`!

---
# Billboard

* What are the **observations** in the data?

--

    + Week since entering the Billboard Hot 100 per song
--

* What are the **variables** in the data?
--

    + Year, artist, track, song length, date entered Hot 100, week since first entered Hot 100 (**spread over many columns**), rank during week (**spread over many columns**)
--

* What are the **values** in the data?
--

    + e.g. 2000; 3 Doors Down; Kryptonite; 3 minutes 53 seconds; April 8, 2000; Week 3 (**stuck in column headings**); rank 68 (**spread over many columns**)

---
# Tidy Data

**Tidy data** (aka "long data") are such that:

--

1. The values for a single observation are in their own row.
--

2. The values for a single variable are in their own column.
--

3. The observations are all of the same nature.

--

Why do we want tidy data?

* Easier to understand many rows than many columns
* Required for plotting in `ggplot2`
* Required for many types of statistical procedures (e.g. hierarchical or mixed effects models)
* Fewer confusing variable names
* Fewer issues with missing values and "imbalanced" repeated measures data

---
# `tidyr`

The `tidyr` package provides functions to tidy up data, similar to `reshape` in Stata or `varstocases` in SPSS. Key functions:

--

* **`gather()`**: takes a set of columns and rotates them down to make two new columns (which you can name yourself): 
    * A `key` that stores the original column names
    * A `value` with the values in those original columns

--

* **`spread()`**: inverts `gather()` by taking two columns and rotating them up into multiple columns

--

* **`separate()`**: pulls apart one column into multiple columns (common with `gather`ed data where values had been embedded in column names)
    * `extract_numeric()` does a simple version of this for the common case when you just want grab the number part

--

* **`extract()`** for spreading a column into multiple *sets* of columns.
   * See [Hadley's response to this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25925556/gather-multiple-sets-of-columns) for an example.

---
# `gather()`

Let's use `gather()` to get the week and rank variables out of their current layout into two columns (big increase in rows, big drop in columns):

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000_raw %>%
    gather(key = week, value = rank, starts_with("wk")) #<<
dim(billboard_2000)
```

`starts_with()` and other helper functions from `dplyr::select()` work here too.

We could instead use: `gather(key = week, value = rank, wk1:wk76)` to pull out these contiguous columns.

---
# `gather`ed Weeks

.smallish[
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(billboard_2000)
```
]

Now we have a single week column!

---
# Gathering Better?

```{r}
summary(billboard_2000$rank)
```

This is an improvement, but we don't want to keep the `r sum(is.na(billboard_2000$rank))` rows with missing ranks (i.e. observations for weeks since entering the Hot 100 that the song was no longer on the Hot 100).

---
# Gathering Better: `na.rm`

The argument `na.rm = TRUE` to `gather()` will remove rows with missing ranks.
```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000_raw %>%
    gather(key = week, value = rank, starts_with("wk"),
           na.rm = TRUE) #<<
summary(billboard_2000$rank)
```

---
# `separate()`

The track length column isn't analytically friendly. Let's convert it to a number rather than the character (minutes:seconds) format:

```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000 %>%
    separate(time, into = c("minutes", "seconds"),
             sep = ":", convert = TRUE) %>% #<<
    mutate(length = minutes + seconds / 60) %>%
    select(-minutes, -seconds)
summary(billboard_2000$length)
```

`sep = :` tells `separate()` to split the column into two where it finds a colon (`:`).

Then we add `seconds / 60` to `minutes` to produce a numeric `length` in minutes.

---
# `parse_number()`

`tidyr` provides a convenience function to grab just the numeric information from a column that mixes text and numbers:

```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000 %>%
    mutate(week = parse_number(week)) #<<
summary(billboard_2000$week)
```

For more sophisticated conversion or pattern checking, you'll need to use string parsing (to be covered in week 8).

---
# `spread()` Motivation

`spread()` is the opposite of `gather()`, which you use if you have data for the same observation taking up multiple rows.

--

Example of data that we probably want to spread (unless we want to plot each statistic in its own facet):

.small[
| **Group** | **Statistic** | **Value** |
|-------|-----------|------:|
| A     | Mean      |  1.28 |
| A     | Median    |   1.0 |
| A     | SD        |  0.72 |
| B     | Mean      |  2.81 |
| B     | Median    |     2 |
| B     | SD        |  1.33 |
]

A common cue to use `spread()` is having measurements of different quantities in the same column. 

---
# Before `spread()`

.smallish[
```{r}
(too_long_data <- data.frame(Group = c(rep("A", 3), rep("B", 3)),
                             Statistic = rep(c("Mean", "Median", "SD"), 2),
                             Value = c(1.28, 1.0, 0.72, 2.81, 2, 1.33)))
```
]

---
# After `spread()`

```{r}
(just_right_data <- too_long_data %>%
    spread(key = Statistic, value = Value))
```

# Charts of 2000: Data Prep

best_rank <- billboard_2000 %>%
    group_by(artist, track) %>%
    summarize(min_rank = min(rank), #<<
              weeks_at_1 = sum(rank == 1)) %>%
    mutate(`Peak rank` = ifelse(min_rank == 1,
                                "Hit #1",
                                "Didn't #1"))

# merge onto original data
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000 %>%
    left_join(best_rank, by = c("artist", "track"))
```

.footnote[Note that because the "highest" rank is *numerically lowest* (1), we are summarizing with `min()`.]

## Which Were #1 the Most Weeks?

```{r}
billboard_2000 %>%
    select(artist, track, weeks_at_1) %>%
    distinct(artist, track, weeks_at_1) %>%
    arrange(desc(weeks_at_1)) %>%
    head(7)
```

# Getting Usable Dates

We have the date the songs first charted, but not the dates for later weeks. We can calculate these now that the data are tidy:

```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000 %>%
    mutate(date = date.entered + (week - 1) * 7) #<<
billboard_2000 %>% arrange(artist, track, week) %>%
    select(artist, date.entered, week, date, rank) %>% head(4)
```

This works because `date` objects are in units of days—we just add 7 days per week to the start date.

##Joining Data

## When Do We Need to Join Data?

* Want to make columns using criteria too complicated for `ifelse()` or `case_when()`

   * We can work with small sets of variables then combine them back together.

* Combine data stored in separate data sets: e.g. UW registrar information with police stop records.

   * Often large surveys are broken into different data sets for each level (e.g. household, individual, neighborhood)

---
## Joining in Concept

We need to think about the following when we want to merge data frames `A` and `B`:

* Which *rows* are we keeping from each data frame?

* Which *columns* are we keeping from each data frame?

* Which variables determine whether rows *match*?

---
## Join Types: Rows and columns kept

There are many types of joins<sup>1</sup>...

* `A %>% left_join(B)`: keep all rows from `A`, matched with `B` wherever possible (`NA` when not), keep columns from both `A` and `B`

* `A %>% right_join(B)`: keep all rows from `B`, matched with `A` wherever possible (`NA` when not), keep columns from both `A` and `B`

* `A %>% inner_join(B)`: keep only rows from `A` and `B` that match, keep columns from both `A` and `B`

* `A %>% full_join(B)`: keep all rows from both `A` and `B`, matched wherever possible (`NA` when not), keep columns from both `A` and `B`

* `A %>% semi_join(B)`: keep rows from `A` that match rows in `B`, keep columns from only `A`

* `A %>% anti_join(B)`: keep rows from `A` that *don't* match a row in `B`, keep columns from only `A`

.pull-right[.footnote[[1] Usually `left_join()` does the job.]]

---
## Matching Criteria

We say rows should *match* because they have some columns containing the same value. We list these in a `by = ` argument to the join.

Matching Behavior:

* No `by`: Match using all variables in `A` and `B` that have identical names

--

* `by = c("var1", "var2", "var3")`: Match on identical values of `var1`, `var2`, and `var3` in both `A` and `B`

--

* `by = c("Avar1" = "Bvar1", "Avar2" = "Bvar2")`: Match identical values of `Avar1` variable in `A` to `Bvar1` variable in `B`, and `Avar2` variable in `A` to `Bvar2` variable in `B`

Note: If there are multiple matches, you'll get *one row for each possible combination* (except with `semi_join()` and `anti_join()`).

Need to get more complicated? Break it into multiple operations.

## `nycflights13` Data

We'll use data in the [`nycflights13` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf).

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

It includes five dataframes, some of which contain missing data (`NA`):

* `flights`: flights leaving JFK, LGA, or EWR in 2013
* `airlines`: airline abbreviations
* `airports`: airport metadata
* `planes`: airplane metadata
* `weather`: hourly weather data for JFK, LGA, and EWR

Note these are *separate data frames*, each needing to be *loaded separately*:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(flights)
data(airlines)
data(airports)
# and so on...
```

---
## Join Example

Who manufactures the planes that flew to SeaTac?

```{r}
flights %>% filter(dest == "SEA") %>% select(tailnum) %>%
    left_join(planes %>% select(tailnum, manufacturer), #<<
              by = "tailnum") %>%
    count(manufacturer) %>% # Count observations by manufacturer
    arrange(desc(n)) # Arrange data descending by count
```

Note you can perform operations on the data inside functions such as `left_join()` and the *output* will be used by the function.

# Visualization Preview

The next workshop will focus on visualization using `ggplot2`.

We could visualize the data we worked with today to understand it better.

# Charts of 2000: `ggplot2`

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
billboard_trajectories <- 
  ggplot(data = billboard_2000,
         aes(x = week, y = rank, group = track,
             color = `Peak rank`)
         ) +
  geom_line(aes(size = `Peak rank`), alpha = 0.4) +
    # rescale time: early weeks more important
  scale_x_log10(breaks = seq(0, 70, 10)) + 
  scale_y_reverse() + # want rank 1 on top, not bottom
  theme_classic() +
  xlab("Week") + ylab("Rank") +
  scale_color_manual("Peak Rank", values = c("black", "red")) +
  scale_size_manual("Peak Rank", values = c(0.25, 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.90, 0.25),
        legend.background = element_rect(fill="transparent"))
```

# Charts of 2000: Beauty!

```{r, cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE, dev="svg", fig.height=4}
billboard_trajectories
```

Observation: There appears to be censoring around week 20 for songs falling out of the top 50 that I'd want to follow up on.
